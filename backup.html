              <p class="mb-4">Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head
                first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the
                privilege of building software for andigital product studio.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for our customers
                at Klaviyo. I most enjoy building software in the sweet
                spot where design and engineering meet — things that look good but are also built well under the hood.
                In my free time, I've also released anonline video
                course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify API.
